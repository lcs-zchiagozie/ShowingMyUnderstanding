 # Sequence - Practice
 
 When does sequence matter?

 Here is an example of an image that is created and depends on statements being run in a certain order:

 ![overlapping_shapes](overlapping-shapes.png "Overlapping Shapes Logo")

 In this shape, there are lines and ellipses used.

 [Color](http://russellgordon.ca/lcs/HSB_Color_Model_Summary_Swift.pdf) and alpha (transparency) matter.

 Try reproducing this image for practice.
 
 NOTE: Colors and image must match precisely.
